## 1. Sidebar & Main Navigation Update

Add a dedicated **Resume** main tab for focused resume editing and syncing:

```
- Home
- Repositories
- Activity
- Content
  - Posts
  - Templates
  - Resume
- Integrations
- Settings
```

***

## 2. UX Flow & Feature Offering

### A. Continuous GitHub Activity Management (Events)

- **Events Stream:**  
  Under **Activity → GitHub Events**, show a real-time list or timeline of events grouped by relevance (commits, PRs, issues, etc.) with summary highlights.

- **Event Batching & Filtering:**  
  When many events arrive (e.g., 20+), batch them by time (daily or weekly) and allow users to review summaries instead of raw event list overload.

- **Smart Notifications:**  
  Notify users about **key event clusters** that may impact social posts or resume updates — e.g., a successful PR merge, significant code changes, or milestones.

***

### B. Resume Tab: Editor and Sync

- **Resume Editor Page:**  
  A single page with:
  - Editable **resume bullets** extracted from user events.
  - Ability to **organize, add, remove, and prioritize bullets**.
  - Preview of the resume content dynamically updated as user edits.

- **Sync Resume Button:**  
  On-demand button to **sync resume** with all latest events, using your backend AI summarization and event processing to generate updated bullets for review.

- **Auto Suggestions:**  
  Provide **auto-suggested bullets/updates** based on recent activity, minimizing manual input.

- **Version Control:**  
  Enable users to save versions or snapshots of resumes as they progress.

***

### C. Social Posts Management (Content → Posts)

- **Posts Dashboard:**  
  Single-page view listing **all pending, drafted, and published posts** with filters by status and date.

- **Post Creation & Editing:**  
  Users can create posts **from events or templates**, edit content in-place.

- **Post Acknowledgement Workflow:**  
  Important: before any post publishes on behalf of the user, it must be **acknowledged/approved explicitly** in this dashboard.

- **Bulk Actions:**  
  When many pending posts exist:
  - Show aggregated post suggestions.
  - Allow **bulk approve or reject** actions or batch editing.
  - Introduce an "autosuggest and queue" mode where recommended posts wait for approval before publishing.

- **Feedback and Analytics:**  
  Show **engagement analytics** per post, and enable users to provide feedback or comments on the post’s performance and generate improvements.

***

## 3. Navigation & Minimal Page Jumps

- Keep all major features like Posts, Resume editor, and Events **accessible via sidebar one or two clicks**.
- Avoid deep multi-step flows; instead:
  - Use **modal dialogs** or side panels for quick edits/reviews (e.g., editing a post or resumes bullet without leaving the main page).
  - **Inline editing** and real-time previews wherever possible.
- Combine related features in the same page with tabs or collapsible sections—for example, Posts dashboard can have a tab for draft posts and another for published posts, all on one URL.

## 4. When & How to Provide Features to Users

### Resume Sync

- **User-initiated:** a "Sync Resume" button in the Resume tab triggers full resume update from all events, but does not immediately publish — user reviews edits first.
- **Auto-sync reminders:** periodically prompt user to sync resume if new relevant events accumulate.

### Post Generation & Updating

- Generate post suggestions **automatically**, updated in real-time or on-demand.
- Queue posts and show in **Posts dashboard**, only publish after user approval.
- Allow users to **acknowledge, reject, or edit** posts easily with minimal friction.
- When many new events arrive, group associated generated posts for simpler batch review.

***

## 5. User Feedback & Control

- Posts and resume changes require explicit user acknowledgment before publishing.
- Provide **clear status indicators** and audit history for each post and resume update.
- Enable users to revert or customize the AI/automatic generated content.
- Maintain **user trust** by keeping them informed and in control of what is shared or updated live.
